Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. I am an electronics engineer interested in all things electronics from high level circuit design to nanoscale device modelling. Besides electronics, I am interested in startups, product development, cricket and comedy. I am also interested in tech in general and regularly explore other domains to enrich my thoughts and also derive ideas and inputs from those areas.

I started this blog mainly to log all my experience and ideas. I am a huge fan of Bunnie Huang and his work. He has a blog called [bunnie:studios](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/) which is why I named my blog perrie:studios. Perrie was derived from my nickname 'Perry the Platypus' aka Agent P.

## My Principles

Here are the top 10 principles I consider the most important. I try my best to apply these to my daily life and become a better person. The order in which they are listed is immaterial as I feel irrespective of what number they are assigned on this page, each principle is as valuable to the development of an individual's character as the other.

### 1. Self-awareness

I feel that it is extremely important to understand who I am as a person, my strengths and weaknesses. Only a honest self-assessment will allow me to know where I stand and where I need to be. I have noticed that I get carried away with small wins which only end up hindering my overall growth rather than actually helping me. At the end of the day winning the war is more important than celebrating a few battles.

### 2. Don't follow the herd

I first heard of the phrase "herd mentality" in grade 7. We all tell ourselves, I am not like the rest of them. However, rarely do we recognize that we are being influenced by the people around us without even noticing. People are always judging us based on what they think is right and so often we end up becoming more like them than ourselves. It's more important to identify who I want to become and act likewise. If the world worked like how everyone around us says, we would only be surrounded by successful people.

### 3. Always have the big picture in mind

Where I want to be in the longer run is more important. If I don't define long term goals, again I get carried away by FOMO (Fear of missing out) when I see other opportunities which may be detrimental to my overall development.

### 4. Keep learning and be proactive

What I know is never enough. We live in the information age and there is so many new things I have no clue about. The world is changing fast and if I don't keep learning, I'll end up being outdated faster than I even realize. It takes lesser effort to keep the wheel spinning than start it.

### 5. Think big, be humble

Big goals motivate me, I know where I want to be. They help me define goals and develop the skills needed to achieve those goals. Like how the popular saying goes, higher the rise, steeper the fall. Hence, it is important to stay grounded.

### 6. Be ethical

I will be honest and ensure it's a win-win for everyone. It's way less stressful achieving things ethically than the long term consequences a selfish action might have. It destroys reputation, credibility and also a lot of time trying to balance out things.

### 7. Get to the fundamentals and be pragmatic

Thinking by first principles, it is important to break everything down to the fundamentals and then approach it.

### 8. Failures are a part of life

Every failure is a humbling experience. In the end of the day, the journey is more fun than the destination. So it is important to savor the important moments that happen everyday and also ensure I am learning something of value during the journey.

### 9. Be perfect in your game

I am strong in what I say I am strong in. Self-confidence is a great positive trait.

### 10. Spread your knowledge

I try to share whatever I learn through experience or formally with anyone who might put it to good use. One of the prime reasons for starting this website was also the same. I wanted to record what I know so that others can benefit out of it.
