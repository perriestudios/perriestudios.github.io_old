Beeclust Multi-Robot Systems Lab is where I got my first hands-on electronics experience. I was recruited in my third semester and continued working with Beeclust until graduation. The countless hours spent in the lab helped refine my perspective in many aspects. Beeclust is a very special place to me and hence I decided to write it down like a journal.

## The Story

### The Beginning

Before Beeclust, self-learning was a mountain that I considered too steep to conquer. I applied to various student teams at my university hoping to learn from seniors. I was rejected by all the teams I applied to. Eventually, in my third semester, one of my classmates told me that a robotics team was recruiting that evening. I decided to give one more shot at joining a technical team. I had mixed-feelings after the interview. It was a pragmatic interview with lot of circuit design related questions. I was able to answer some of them intuitively, but failed miserably in recollecting the theory. I conveyed that I was bad because I never got a chance to learn and if provided with a chance to learn, I promised to work hard and prove myself.

My senior Kedar, trusted me and provided me with a chance to prove myself. This seemingly insignificant decision has had a huge impact in my life since then (A couple of years later, Kedar told me that he liked my confidence and clarity of thought and decided to take a chance selecting me). There I was, 'Junior Electronics Engineer' with the least experience and technical knowledge among the newly recruited peeps. My first task was to design 10 circuits for an initiative to teach under privileged children the basics of electronics. Through this exercise, I mastered the fundamentals with the basic electronic components like transistors. My next project was a huge promotion: Kedar asked me to design a robot to compete in the All Japan Micromouse Competition. This was a huge leap of faith for a variety of reasons. I was still the least experienced (maybe knowledgeable too) engineer in the lab; and had to design the second biggest project of the lab independently. The robot was highly complex but I wanted to build it. So, I started learning PCB Design, Firmware Design, Mechanical Design while also trying to design a maze solving algorithm with PID control.

### The Transition

A couple of months later, I decided to spend my semester vacations at the lab rejecting an internship as Kedar was also going to stay back. I learnt the fundamentals of PCB Design and firmware development from him which helped me go a long way later. We also came across the International Autonomous Robotics Competition at IIT Kanpur and agreed to build a team and participate. I individually built a robot for autonomously following a line, walls and make choices by detecting colors. I had my Eureka! moment when I witnessed the working of PID controller for the first time. The robot was extremely agile with the algorithm. The code written for that competition was reused in all the following competitions and helped us win all of them. It was disappointing to finish 8th out of 40 teams in the International Finals after a really good performance in the earlier National Finals round. I was motivated than ever and also gained some confidence having led a team of seniors in the competition.

### The Growth

I worked really hard after the competition, spending lot of time improving my Embedded System skills. I also started multi-tasking for the first time, designing PCBs for the main research project at that time - Sprinter, leading the Micromouse project with new recruits, participating in competitions and also assisting with anything the lab required. Being a day scholar, the lab was my go-to spot between non class hours. This also earned me the reputation of being the most hardworking guy in the lab (As if I had a choice xD). Although my faculty advisor and Kedar kept telling every student about how I spend even my vacations in the lab. We also organized a PCB Design, Manufacturing and Assembly for fellow SRMites. The workshop turned out to be really good and even our team had a lot of fun organizing it. We wanted to host 75 participants. A Beeclust shaped PCB Keychain with IC555 was to be designed. We ordered the PCBs in advance and packed it into individual kits. Each kit would contain a PCB, components to be soldered, tweezers and Beeclust merchandise (stickers & badge). The idea was that we would teach the participants how to design a PCB in the morning followed by pick-n-place session.

Soon, Shashank and Shreshth joined the lab and it was my responsibility to onboard them into the project. Kedar and I decided to introduce some standard assignment which would help our recruits learn the most important aspects of Embedded System Design and start working very soon. The line follower is a great place to start with. It used pretty much all the different components of an Embedded System Design. For the PCB Design however, it was left up to me to decide what activity I wanted them to take up. After some searching, I decided to teach people how to design a LED Matrix. The idea was that, it contained a microcontroller and people will learn how to design microcontroller circuitry. So I organized a 1 day internal workshop to teach our team how to design PCB with a microcontroller. We also got pretty big at this point as a team, we observed that people were no longer involved in everything like the old days. There were dedicated teams with leads for robotics, electronics hardware, mechanical, software and even public relations. Our social media presence spiked at that point. We also started travelling around participating in events. Our university offered us a space to exhibit our project at the IOT India Congress 2018. Sprinter received a lot of attention at that event. Three teams from Beeclust were selected for the final round of Siemens Make It Real Hackathon 2018 and we went bonkers. I was also now given additional responsibility of managing the finances; purchase parts and maintain accounts.

### The Crisis

After a fairy tale run, what followed in the next semester was quite shocking. We were a team that thrived on spontaneity. We took up a diverse range of activities and were pretty successful. Our core research team however was still weak. We had just Kedar who was doing all the heavy lifting in the research. At times, we also felt ourselves straying away from the research part and becoming just another team participating in competitions. We had always prided ourselves as being the only student run research lab at our university. Kedar was going to graduate in less than 6 months. Sprinter was no where near completion. We were still facing issues with the locomotion. Finding the right motors was a real pain. We were out of funds. Our faculty advisors I would have to say were anything but satisfied. All of us felt the pressure.

### Averting the Worst

To relieve some of our financial worries, we ran a crowd funding campaign online. We were only able to raise 10% of our goal but that helped us buy some essential components and push the project towards completion. I also organized some of the seniors to form a management team within Beeclust which will share the workload of Kedar. I felt that this will make people more concerned about the team and also help us find a team principal to lead the team after Kedar. Personally, becoming the Team Principal was the best thing for me at that point and there was nobody who would have objected to it either. However, I felt that it should not be the case for the sake of the team. Because, I was still a day scholar who lived 30kms from campus. The team can never function properly with a leader who is absent for the best part of the working hours (our happy hours were usually between 5-9 PM). So the management team was functional for about a couple of months and things were coming back on track.

Around this time, I strongly voiced that it was time to put the past behind and start a new project which will boost the interest of a lot of juniors in the lab and also give us a chance not to repeat the mistakes we were previously doing. So, we proposed LOGISWARM to the Directorate of Research at our university. We were granted double the amount of funds than Sprinter which was a big win for the team. All the students in the team were given a chance to contribute towards the proposal for the project and the best of them were enlisted as the investigators for the project.

### The Last Mile

We recruited more folks. Having never been part of previous recruitment drives, this recruitment was the first one in which I got involved. One of the reasons was that, I felt our team was not picking the right guys previously. So this time, I suggested that we pick the most passionate guys instead of the smartest ones. Luckily we even found smart guys like Sivin, Gautham, Khushagra and Mayank. With funds, Sprinter was also back on. We were also now having a robotics research team which was growing from strength to strength. We were building our computer vision system on ROS. The robotics team helped us complete the last leg of Sprinter and allowed us to submit the work for publication in IROS and ICAR.

We sent a team to Delhi to participate in the line follower competition at Technoxian-2019. We also decided to participate in the MathWorks Minidrone Competition. Gautham built a really good simulation model in the first round of the competition. We were selected for the competition at both NUMA and IROS. I also got a chance to participate in an International Competition outside India. I dreamed of atleast participating in an International Competition when I applied to a lot of teams in my first year of engineering. In the final year, there I was leading a winning team in an International Competition. We were also the first and possibly the last team to win the competition twice :P. IROS was an amazing event to be part of, and Macau was also an awesome place (loved the egg tarts from Lord Stow's bakery). I was able to sign-off from Beeclust on a high leaving Beeclust at its best semester ever.
