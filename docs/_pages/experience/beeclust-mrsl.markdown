Beeclust Multi-Robot Systems Lab is where I developed most of my skills and thoughts around electronics. I was recruited during my third semester and continued working with Beeclust until graduation and continue to engage with the current batch of students regularly. The countless hours spent in the lab helped refine my perspective beyond just the technical stuff. This page of my experience section holistically covers the transformation that I went through.

### The Beginning

I joined Beeclust as a complete accident. Before Beeclust, self-learning was a mountain that I considered too steep to conquer. So I was applying to various student teams at SRM University hoping to learn from some good seniors. All the attempts failed and I resorted to undertaking online courses in Satellite Communication and Wireless Communication from Coursera as Communication Engineering had prompted me to select ECE as my UG course. It was just another day in the third semester and one of my classmates told me that a robotics team was conducting interviews that evening. I decided to give one more shot at joining a team after a long gap. I had mixed-feelings after the interview. It was a very pragmatic interview with lot of circuit design related questions. I was able to design some of them, but failed miserably in the theoretical section. However, I firmly insisted that I was looking for a chance to learn and promised to work hard to improve my technical knowledge.

It came as a surprise to find out that I was selected. My senior Kedar, followed his gut and believed that I would be able to contribute to the lab. This small act has made such a huge impact in my life since then. There I was, the 'Junior Electronics Engineer' with the least experience and technical knowledge among the new recruits. My first task was to design 10 circuits for a initiative to teach under privileged children the basics of electronics. Through this exercise, I acquainted myself with the basic electronic components like transistors. My next project was a huge one: Kedar asked me to design a robot to compete in the All Japan Micromouse Competition. This was a huge for a variety of reasons. I was still the least experienced engineer in the lab; had to design the entire system independently and it was the second biggest project of the lab. The robot was highly complex but I was motivated to build it. I started learning PCB Design, Firmware Design, Mechanical Design while also trying to design a maze solving algorithm with PID control.

### The Transition

A couple of months later, we came across the International Autonomous Robotics Competition at IIT Kanpur. I built a robot which was capable of autonomously follow a line, walls and make choices by detecting colors. I witness the working of PID controller in action for the first time and was awestruck by its performance. The robot was extremely agile with the algorithm. The code written for that competition was reused in all the following competitions and helped us win all of them. It was disappointing to finish 8th out of 40 teams in the International Finals after a really good performance in the earlier National Finals round. I was more motivated than ever and I also gained some confidence having led a team of senior in the competition.

### The Growth

I worked really hard after the competition, spending lot of time improving my Embedded System skills. I also started multi-tasking for the first time, designing PCBs for the main research project Sprinter, managing Micromouse, participating in competitions and also assisting with anything required at the lab. I co-designed all the working iteration of PCBs of the Sprinter robot. Micromouse had more engineers working on it and I was the lead of the project, so I had to meticulously keep planning. We participated in competitions because we were building better robots each time and they also served as a good way to take some time off research. I was also travelling to various events like the IOT India Congress exhibiting our projects. This was the most productive phase of my time at Beeclust and the time invested during this phase paid good dividends later.

### The Last Mile

I became the team principal.
