I picked up a lot of skills through youtube. Through this page, I would like to mention some of the best youtube channels I have come across categorically.

## Electronics

### [EEV Blog](https://www.youtube.com/c/EevblogDave)

Great place for all things electronics. Dave Jones covers the theory in great detail which makes the channel standout. Some of older videos covering the manufacturing of electronic products are also amazing. Occasionally, he also dissects the theory behind products that are designed to fail.

### [Robert Feranec](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertFeranec)

Best PCB Design channel out there. His Altium and Ki-Cad tutorials are great because I designed PCBs that worked the first time on both the software. You can learn tips and tricks that differentiate a great PCB designer from a good PCB designer.

### [Gary Explains](https://www.youtube.com/c/GaryExplains)

Channel for all the computer architecture freaks. He also covers topics pertaining to the semiconductor industry.

### [Sayanee Basu](https://www.youtube.com/c/SayaneeBasu)

She has some great tips in PCB Design and project planning that beginners can really use. Great channel for all the people who are starting out.

### [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/c/PhilS94)

Has some great content in High Speed PCB and firmware design.

### Hobbyists

Some of the channels that are focussed around projects are [Andreas Speiss](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasSpiess), [Carl Bugeja](https://www.youtube.com/c/CarlBugeja), [Great Scott](https://www.youtube.com/c/greatscottlab), [Stephen Hawes](https://www.youtube.com/c/StephenTheRobot) and [Electronoobs](https://www.youtube.com/c/ELECTRONOOBS). Each of them specialize in their own area with the exception being Great Scott and Electronoobs.

## Startups and Business

### [Coldfusion](https://www.youtube.com/c/ColdFusion)

Contains extremely detailed videos of significant companies and products. Trust me, once you start watching his videos, you'll not stop.

### [Justin Kan](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinKanTV)

He shares his knowledge he gained building twitch and his thoughts related to start-ups.

### [Slidebean](https://www.youtube.com/c/Slidebean)

One stop spot for all questions related to startups. He breaks it down to first principles for beginners. I personally leart a lot about startup funding and raising money in this channel. He also does startup forensics of failed companies.

### [Asianometry](https://www.youtube.com/c/Asianometry)

He covers the business aspect of electronics, which bridges my interests. Solid channel for people looking to learn about the economics of electronics.

## Other Interesting Content

### [Jake Tran](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOjH8D2XAgjzQlneM2W0EQ)

He covers a wide range of topics. The content is engrossing and videos are edited really well.

### [Johnny Harris](https://www.youtube.com/c/johnnyharris)

He covers specific geographic issues and current affairs. Videos are well researched and compressed.

### [Retro Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/c/Perifractic)

Nostalgia. It feels like an era I lived in even though I didn't. Older peeps will certainly enjoy it.

### [Techquickie](https://www.youtube.com/c/Techquickie)

Technology explained for dummies, Including me :P
